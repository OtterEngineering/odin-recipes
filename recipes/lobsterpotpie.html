    <h5>Description</h5>
        <p>Delicious albeit an unconventional way of serving lobster.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
           <li>1 (3 ounce) package dry crab boil (such as Zatarain's Crab & Shrimp Boil)</li>
           <li>5 small lobster tails</li> 
           <li>1 (15 ounce) package double crust ready-to-use pie crust (such as Pillsbury)</li>
           <li>5 tablespoons butter</li>
           <li>1/2 cup diced onion</li>
           <li>1/2 cup diced celery</li>
           <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
           <li>1 1/2 cups chicken broth</li>
           <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon seafood seasoning, such as Old Bayâ„¢</li>
           <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
           <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
           <li>1 1/2 cups frozen mixed vegetables, thawed</li>
           <li>1/2 cup diced potato</li>

        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bring water and crab boil to a boil in a large saucepan.</li>
            <li>Stir in lobster tails and boil until they turn bright red and the meat becomes opaque, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain and cool lobster tails. Remove shells, and dice lobster meat. Transfer to a bowl.</li>
            <li>Place a pie crust into the bottom of a 9-inch pie pan and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and celery in butter until tender, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir flour into onion and celery mixture until vegetables are coated.</li>
            <li>Combine chicken broth and milk in a bowl. Slowly stir broth and milk into onion, celery, and flour mixture until thickened. Stir seafood seasoning, garlic powder, and black pepper into thickened sauce.</li>
            <li>Mix thawed vegetables, diced potato, and cooked lobster meat into the sauce; simmer until potato is tender, about 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour lobster filling into the prepared pie crust.</li>
            <li>Cover with remaining pie crust and seal by crimping the edges of the two crusts together. Cut an X into top of pie crust with a sharp knife to allow steam to escape during baking.</li>
            <li>Bake pie in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes.

            </li>
            <li>Remove from oven and let stand for 10 to 15 minutes to allow sauce to thicken.

            </li>
        </ol>
